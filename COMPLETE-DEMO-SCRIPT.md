# 🏆 Complete Hackathon Demo Script

## 🎯 **The Full Demo Journey (5-7 minutes)**

This script demonstrates the complete AI-powered banking system troubleshooting workflow, including the learning capability.

---

## **PART 1: View Initial Database** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Please show me the current solutions database"

**Expected:** Claude calls `view_solutions_database` and shows 6 solutions with success rates (85%, 94%, etc.)

---

## **PART 2: Create Banking Crisis** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Run in terminal:**
```bash
./create-banking-incident.sh
```

**Say to Claude:**
> "Please analyze my banking system for critical problems"

**Expected:** Claude finds 7-10 critical issues including security breaches, payment failures, data corruption

---

## **PART 3: Apply Known Solutions** ⏱️ *2 minutes*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Find solutions for the security breach and apply them"

**Expected:** 
- Claude finds Security Incident Response (94% success rate)
- Shows compatibility scores and platform-specific commands
- Applies the banking incident cleanup solution
- Most problems get resolved

---

## **PART 4: Create Unknown Problem** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Run in terminal:**
```bash
./create-custom-problem.sh
```

**Say to Claude:**
> "Detect problems again and find solutions for any integration issues"

**Expected:**
- Claude detects "Third-Party Integration SSL & API Failure"
- Searches for solutions but finds NONE
- Offers to create support ticket

---

## **PART 5: Support Ticket Workflow** ⏱️ *2 minutes*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Yes, please create a support ticket for the third-party integration SSL failure with critical urgency"

**Expected:** Claude creates ticket with ID like `TICKET-1234567-ABC123`

**Wait 3 minutes, then say:**
> "Check the status of ticket TICKET-1234567-ABC123"

**Expected:** Claude shows ticket is "RESOLVED" with solution ready

---

## **PART 6: Simulate Support Resolution** ⏱️ *1 minute*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Simulate support resolution for ticket TICKET-1234567-ABC123 with solution title 'Fix Banking Integration SSL and API Issues' and commands: ['systemctl restart api-gateway', 'openssl verify /etc/ssl/banking-certs.pem']"

**Expected:** 
- Claude creates new solution in database
- Shows solution ID and details
- Confirms knowledge base updated

---

## **PART 7: Verify Learning** ⏱️ *1 minute*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Show me the solutions database again and find solutions for third_party_integration_ssl_failure"

**Expected:**
- Database now shows 7 solutions (was 6) 
- New solution appears with 50% starting success rate
- Integration problem now has a matching solution

---

## **PART 8: Apply New Solution** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Apply the new banking integration solution"

**Expected:** Claude applies the newly learned solution successfully

---

## **PART 9: Final Verification** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Detect problems one final time to confirm everything is resolved"

**Expected:** Only 2 minor disk issues remain (normal macOS filesystems)

---

## **PART 10: Reset for Next Demo** ⏱️ *30 seconds*

**Say to Claude:**
> "Reset the demo environment for the next presentation"

**Expected:** Claude cleans everything and confirms ready for next demo

---

## 🚀 **Demo Commands Quick Reference**

```bash
# Setup (run BEFORE each demo)
./reset-to-demo-state.sh          # Start with 6 solutions
./create-banking-incident.sh      # Create banking crisis
./create-custom-problem.sh        # Create unknown problem

# Claude Commands
"show me the solutions database"
"analyze my banking system for problems"
"find solutions for security_breach_detected"
"apply the security incident response solution"
"create a support ticket for banking_integration_failure with critical urgency"
"check ticket status TICKET-[ID]"
"simulate support resolution for ticket [ID]"
"view solutions database"
"reset demo environment"
```

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting**

**If processes don't stop:**
```bash
pkill -f "memory_leak_simulator"
pkill -f "database_load_simulator"  
pkill -f "integration_failure_simulator"
```

**If database gets corrupted:**
```bash
rm -f solutions_database.json
# It will regenerate automatically
```

**If demo files remain:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/banking_incident_demo
rm -rf ~/custom_banking_problem
rm -rf ./support_tickets
```
